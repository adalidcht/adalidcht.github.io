Hallo ðŸ¦¾ âœ¨, i'm passionate about artificial intelligence and currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in bionic engineering in Mexico City. 

During my time at university, I had the privilege of leading two teams in two programming challenges organized by IEEE, as a member of EMB. 

My expertise lies in artificial intelligence using Python and PyTorch. I always strive to give my best in every project, and I never cease to learn.
